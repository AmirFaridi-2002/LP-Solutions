The usage of this repo is simple, if you have a latex compiler, then clone it and in order to add solutions to a particular problem, you can add a file in its directory with the same name with '-A' appended at the end and then compiling the main.tex file should show it in the pdf, for example you add the file 'Problem-1-A.tex' in the Streicher/Chapter2 folder.

The structure of the repo is as follows:
- The Barendregt book: has 4 exercises which are listed in the folder Barendregt
- The Streicher book: currently only planning on solving up to chapter 7, in the folder Streicher there are folders for each Chapter that had exercises. In the problem statment files, you can see which page the problem is in, in the case of multiple problems on the same page, they're expected to be in order.

Please add both the problem statement and your solution in order to keep a neat and tidy result!
